# Andy - One-Click Shopping

Created by Eric Chen, Ria Sharma, Sahitya Senapathy, and Dhruv Shah

Andy is your personal shopper -- automate away filling out all the tedious checkout fields like shipping address, billing info, and shirt size that you have to fill out every time you want to purchase something. 

Andy's built on Twilio's SMS API and a Django REST backend that runs Selenium for automation and form filling and connects to a MongoDB database. We have also built a Chrome Extension for shopping on your browser.
